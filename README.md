# switch-mono

This is a port of the Switch codebase found here -> https://github.com/elennick/switch-xna

This project ports the code from the XNA 3.1/XBLIG project released in 2010 to instead use MonoGame 3.5 and be targeted at Windows. More details on this type of port in case it's useful to anyone:
